<h3>About the project</h3>
This project has several functionalities besides the basic ones of a calculator and they are:
<ul>
  <li>Reuse the result of an operation by clicking on any mathematical symbol. </li>
  <li>Reset the calculator when you click on any number when the result is already displayed.</li>
  <li>The calculator is adapted to mobile, tablet and pc</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bugs</h4>
The calculator has some bugs that will be corrected as for example:
<ul>
  <li>If you click on any mathematical symbol and no number is assigned to the first number, the result will be NaN.</li>
  <li>Some calculations are not done in a correct way. </li>
  <li>When the result is reused, the mathematical sign is not assigned in the first attempt, in the second attempt when the result is already in the value of the first number, the mathematical sign is assigned.</li>
</ul>
